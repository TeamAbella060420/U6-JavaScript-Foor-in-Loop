 Using `for in` to Loop Through an Object's Properties - Using a for...in loop to access each key (or property name) in an object.
Storing Objects in Arrays - Arrays let you group values to build complex data structures. With an array, you store a collection of elements you can access by their position (or index). Objects take that concept further by providing a way to structure related data that's easy to read and retrieve using key/value pairs. It's common to combine the two by creating an array of objects.
